# MaQnus

Welcome to the **MaQnus** repository! The methods and examples provided here are based on the approach outlined in the paper:

**"Quantum Simulation of Highly-Oscillatory Many-Body Hamiltonians for Near-Term Devices"**

## Repository Overview

This repository includes essential Python functions and a Jupyter Notebook that serves as an interactive guide for configuring, running, and analyzing some Hamiltonian simulations.

### Key Components

- **Python Files (`.py` files)**: Modules with key functions and algorithms needed for quantum simulation.
- **`Demostration.ipynb`**: The main demonstration notebook where users can explore each method and configure parameters.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following packages are installed:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`

## Usage

Open the `Demostration.ipynb` notebook and execute each cell to configure parameters, compute solutions, and compare methods.
